"""Interact with the Application Framework Directory-Sync Service API.

To obtain rich information about users and devices for the purposes of
reporting and policy enforcement, cloud-based applications need access
to directory information. However, most directories are located
on-premise so they cannot be accessed by cloud-based applications.
The Directory Sync Service allows cloud-based applications to access
directory data by using an on-premise agent to collect it, and then
transferring the data to the cloud-based Directory Sync Service.

Examples:
    Refer to the examples provided with this library and/or the official
    Reference Application.
