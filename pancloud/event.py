"""Interact with the Application Framework Event Service API.

The Event Service allows your application to consume log data using a
subscription (pull) model. When a customer activates your application in
the Cloud Services Portal, a channel is assigned to it. This channel is
dedicated to the customer's application instance. The channel will
contain no data for any other customer,or any other application
instance. You will receive this channel's ID as a part of the process
that provisions your app for the customer in Palo Alto Network's
Application Framework.

Examples:
    Refer to the examples provided with this library and/or the official
    Reference Application.
