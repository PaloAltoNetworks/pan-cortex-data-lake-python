====================================
Welcome to pancloud's documentation!
====================================

The Palo Alto Networks Cloud Python SDK (or ``pancloud`` for short) was created to empower
developers to write innovative security solutions using the Palo Alto Networks Application Framework.

The primary goal of this library is to provide full, low-level coverage for the following Application Framework services:

    - Logging Service
    - Directory Sync Service
    - Event Service

The secondary goal is to provide coverage, in the form of helpers, for common tasks/operations.

    - Log/event pagination
    - OAuth 2.0 and token refreshing
    - More, coming soon.
