# Palo Alto Networks Cortex™ Data Lake SDK

Python idiomatic SDK for the Cortex™ Data Lake.

The Palo Alto Networks Cortex Data Lake Python SDK was created to assist
developers with programmatically interacting with the Palo Alto Networks
Cortex™ Data Lake API.

The primary goal is to provide full, low-level API coverage for the
following Cortex™ Data Lake services:

-   Query Service

The secondary goal is to provide coverage, in the form of helpers, for
common tasks/operations.

-   Log/event pagination
-   OAuth 2.0 and token refreshing
-   More, coming soon!

-   Documentation: <https://cortex.pan.dev>
-   Free software: ISC license

---

## Features

-   HTTP client wrapper for the popular Requests library with full access to its features.
-   Language bindings for Query Service.
-   Helper methods for performing common tasks, such as log/event pagination.
-   Support for OAuth 2.0 grant code authorization flow.
-   Library of example scripts illustrating how to leverage the SDK.
-   Support for API Explorer Developer Tokens for easier access to API!

## Status

The Palo Alto Networks Cortex™ Data Lake Python SDK is considered **alpha** at this time.

## Installation

From PyPI:

    $ pip install pan-cortex-data-lake

## Obtaining and Using OAuth 2.0 Tokens

If you're an app developer, work with your Developer Relations representative to obtain your OAuth2 credentials. API Explorer may optionally be used to generate a Developer Token, which can also be used to authenticate with the API. For details on API Explorer developer tokens, please visit <https://cortex.pan.dev>.

# Example

```python
>>> from pan_cortex_data_lake import Credentials, QueryService
>>> c = Credentials()
>>> qs = QueryService(credentials=c)
>>> query_params = {
...     "query": "SELECT * FROM `1234567890.firewall.traffic` LIMIT 1",
... }
>>> q = qs.create_query(query_params=query_params)
>>> q.status_code
201
>>> q.json()
{'jobId': '40fedce6-ddf5-44cf-9af2-7c3d5303f388', 'uri': '/query/v2/jobs/40fedce6-ddf5-44cf-9af2-7c3d5303f388'}
>>> results = qs.get_job_results(job_id='40fedce6-ddf5-44cf-9af2-7c3d5303f388')
>>> results.json()
```
