Palo Alto Networks Cloud Python SDK
====================

Python idiomatic SDK for the Palo Alto Networks Application Framework.

The Palo Alto Networks Cloud Python SDK was created to assist 3rd-party developers programmatically interact
with the various APIs implemented by the Palo Alto Networks Application Framework. The primary goal
is to provide full, low-level API coverage for the following services:

    - Logging Service
    - Directory Sync Service
    - Event Service

The secondary goal is to provide coverage, in the form of helper methods, for common high-level tasks/operations.

Status
------

The Palo Alto Networks Cloud Python SDK is considered **beta** at this time.

Installation
------------

The easiest method to install the Palo Alto Networks Cloud Python SDK is to clone the repo to your dev machine::

    $ git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pancloud.git

Use |pipenv| to install all dependencies and create a virtualenv for your project::

    $ pipenv install

You can specify which python version to use by adding "--two" or "--three" to pipenv install or shell arguments::

    $ pipenv --three install

Enter a pipenv shell::

    $ pipenv shell

Example
--------------

To run the provided example scripts you'll first need to acquire a `client_id`, `client_secret`, `instanceId` and a registered `redirect_uri`. These items are necessary to perform OAuth and retrieve tokens.

The following example assumes an ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable has been exported::

    $ ./logging_query.py

    QUERY: {"queryId":"356a1975-18d5-4566-8c63-760b721644fa","pageNumber":0,"status":"RUNNING","clientParams":{},"result":{"esResult":null,"esQuery":{"table":["panw.traffic"],"query":{"aggregations":{},"size":1}}}}
